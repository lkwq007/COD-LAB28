   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

DataRAM.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

DataRAM.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.
